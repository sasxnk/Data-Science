# Data-Science

The project is a sentiment analysis project that involves collecting tweets using the Twitter API and analyzing them to determine their sentiment. The goal of the project is to classify the tweets into positive, negative, and neutral categories based on the content of the tweets.


The project involves several steps, including data collection using Tweepy, data preprocessing using the NLTK toolkit, and model building using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. The data is cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and emojis, and lowering the case of the words.
The sentiment analysis is performed using the sentiment score of the tweets, where a positive score corresponds to a positive sentiment, a negative score corresponds to a negative sentiment, and a neutral score corresponds to a neutral sentiment. The sentiment score is added as a column to the dataset.


The project is a multiclass classification problem as it involves classifying tweets into three categories. SVM and Naive Bayes are used for model building, as they are effective algorithms for multiclass classification problems.


Overall, the project aims to provide insights into the sentiment of tweets related to a particular topic, which can be useful for businesses, organizations, and individuals in making decisions and understanding public opinion.
